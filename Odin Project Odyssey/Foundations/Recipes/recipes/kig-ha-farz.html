	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Prepare the Meat and Vegetables:
			<br>In a large cauldron, combine the enchanted beef and phantom pork belly with the mystical broth.
			<br>Bring to a gentle simmer, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.
			<br>Add the sliced magical carrots, mystical turnips, and wizard's leek to the pot.
			<br>Season with Dead Sea salt and ground peppercorn sprites.
			<br>Cover and let simmer for about 2 hours until the meat is tender.
		</li>
		<li>
			Make the Farz:
			<br>In a bowl, mix the dark buckwheat flour with the phantom egg, buttermilk, and a pinch of fairy salt to form a thick dough.
			<br>Form the dough into small dumplings and wrap each in a cheesecloth tightly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cook the Farz:
			<br>Place the wrapped dumplings in the simmering broth with the meat and vegetables.
			<br>Cover and cook for an additional hour.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finish and Serve:
			<br>Once the dumplings are cooked through and the meat is tender, remove the dumplings and unwrap them.
